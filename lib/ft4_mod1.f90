!$omp threadprivate(dd4)
  ! CE3TSK: dd4 is the thread's working copy of the period - each slice subtracts into its own.
  ! The samples arrive on the master thread (jt9.f90 / jt9a.f90), so the pristine period is kept
  ! here, shared and read only, and every slice starts from it: the same shape as FT8's
  ! dd8/dd8orig/dd8delta.
  !
  ! The deltas are kept even though nothing in FT4 consumes the band today. An FT4 TX background
  ! is planned, and that is precisely what needs the merged band - FT8 builds it as
  ! dd8merged = dd8orig + sum of the slice deltas, summed **in slice order** so the result does
  ! not depend on which thread ran which slice. Collecting them now keeps the two decoders the
  ! same shape and saves retrofitting the merge later; the cost is one buffer per slice.
  real, allocatable :: dd4orig(:), dd4delta(:,:)
  ! CE3TSK: subtractft4's work space. It used to be common/heap8/ - one copy for the whole
  ! program, which two slices subtracting at once would overwrite. Making the common block
  ! threadprivate fixed the race but put 2.5 MB per thread into the static TLS block, and glibc
  ! carves that block out of the same 8 MB mapping as the thread's stack: every worker thread
  ! then died unless the caller raised OMP_STACKSIZE. As allocatables only the descriptors sit
  ! in TLS and the buffers live on the heap, allocated once per thread on first use.

  ! the message text: it carries the callsigns, so two stations cannot collide.

! CE3TSK: the FT4 hint memory. JTDX's FT4 decoder had no hint pass at all (stophint there only
! trims the AP passes); FT8's hint decoder re-tries every message of the previous same-parity
! period on a candidate at the same frequency and DT, and its four-period memory (P11) was
! worth +6 % on the air. For FT4 the same idea is built on the decoder's own a-priori path: a
! stored message that matches a candidate within 3 Hz and 0.1 s becomes one extra pass with
! all 77 message bits fixed, exactly how the RR73 AP type 6 already works, so the acceptance
! criterion is the one JTDX ships. ft4cur holds this period's decodes; ft4even/ft4odd(:,k) the
! decodes of the k-th previous period of the same parity (a 7.5 s period's parity is its index
! in the minute: 0, 15, 30, 45 s even; 7.5, 22.5, 37.5, 52.5 s odd). decoder.f90 rotates them
! at the start of every period and empties them on a band or mode change.
! JTDX_FT4_HINT_DEPTH=0..8 overrides the depth (0 = no hint pass, JTDX's behaviour).
